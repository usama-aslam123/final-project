It is the portion of the cycle time where no work is being done to advance the process. This includes time spent in transferring information about the case between process participants
true



When analyzing a process with the aim of addressing issues related to cycle time, It may be useful to start by evaluating the ratio of overall processing time relative to the overall cycle time. This ratio is called:
cycle time efficiency



it is a work that is performed within a business process. 
Activity



It is the portion of the cycle time where no work is being done to advance the process. This includes time spent in transferring information about the case between process participants

Waiting Time


The time that resources (e.g. process participants or software applications invoked by the process) spend on actually handling the case
Processing Time




When analyzing a process with the aim of addressing issues related to cycle time, It may be useful to start by evaluating the ratio of overall processing time relative to the overall cycle time. This ratio is called:

cycle time efficiency

It is a subject that may be approached from different angles. In abroad sense, it may refer to the intent to automate any conceivable part of proceduralwork that is contained within a business process, from simple operations that arepart of a single process activity up to the automated coordination of entire, complex processes.
Process Automation


Which of the followings are true about Value Chain:
all of the above



It is the portion of the cycle time where no work is being done to advance the process. This includes time spent in transferring information about the case between process participants
False

The purpose of a BPMS is to coordinate an automated business process in sucha way that all work is done at the right time by the right resource.
True

Central to the BPMS is the execution engine. The engine providesdifferent functionalities including:
all of the above

A process model can be__________ to the engine in order to be executed.
deployed

__________is the component of a BPMS through whichprocess participants are (i) offered work items and (ii) commit to these.
Worklist Handler


The external application has to expose a service interface with which the enginecan interact. Thus, we simply refer to such applications as:
External services

acThey are made by domain experts and provides a basis for communication amongst relevant stakeholders.
to be executed process model
conceptual process model
conceptual "to be" process model

Exceptions are ________ that deviate a process from its normal course
events

By default a __________ is embedded within its parent process model, and as such it can only be invoked from within that process model.
sub-proces

An event-based exclusive split is represented by a gateway marked by an empty ________ enclosed in a double-line circle.
pentagon

Time taken by value-adding activities:
Processing Time

Time taken by non value-adding activities:
Waiting Time

Cost measures:
processing cost + cost of waste = per instance cost

Resource Utilization =
Time spent per resource on process work / Time available per resource for process work

What is the cycle time? A=50%%, B=50
25

CT formula for AND gateway:
CT = max(T1, T2,â€¦, TN)

CT formula for REWORK gateway:
CT = T / (1-r)

Tasks that can executed by an external application or internally to the BPMS, for example checking the stock availability through an ERP system or retrieving a document from a DMS :
Automated task

Tasks where process participants need to provide input to the process, typically via the use of web forms:
User task

To create and modify executable process models (by specifying execution properties):
Process modeling tool

Offers work items to process participants and allows participants to commit to these work items:
Worklist Handler
