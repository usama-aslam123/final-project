It is the portion of the cycle time where no work is being done to advance the process. This includes time spent in transferring information about the case between process participants
true



When analyzing a process with the aim of addressing issues related to cycle time, It may be useful to start by evaluating the ratio of overall processing time relative to the overall cycle time. This ratio is called:
cycle time efficiency



it is a work that is performed within a business process. 
Activity



It is the portion of the cycle time where no work is being done to advance the process. This includes time spent in transferring information about the case between process participants

Waiting Time


The time that resources (e.g. process participants or software applications invoked by the process) spend on actually handling the case

False


BPMN symbols are categorized into four main groups: 

flow objects, connecting objects, swim lanes, and artifacts.



Which type of gateway moves each token it receives in one of its input arcs to its output arc?
XOR-join

Timer event indicates an error in the flow and can present as Start, Intermediate and End event of BPM process model:
False

A set of activities aiming to systematically deﬁne the set of business processes of a company and establish clear criteria for prioritizing them.
Process Identification

For each process, it should be determined how susceptible they are to process management initiatives, either incidental or on a continuous basis.
Feasibility



To manage automation solutions and configure access to system components:
Administration & Monitoring Tools


Offers work items to process participants and allows participants to commit to these work items:
Worklist Handler



To create and modify executable process models (by specifying execution properties):
Execution Engine


Tasks where process participants need to provide input to the process, typically via the use of web forms:
User task

Tasks that can executed by an external application or internally to the BPMS, for example checking the stock availability through an ERP system or retrieving a document from a DMS :
Automated task





CT formula for REWORK gateway:
CT = T / (1-r)

CT formula for AND gateway:
CT = max(T1, T2,…, TN)



What is the cycle time? A=50%%, B=50
25


Resource Utilization =
Time spent per resource on process work / Time available per resource for process work


Cost measures:
processing cost + cost of waste = per instance cost


Time taken by non value-adding activities:
Waiting Time


Time taken by value-adding activities:
Processing Time


An event-based exclusive split is represented by a gateway marked by an empty ________ enclosed in a double-line circle.
pentagon

By default a __________ is embedded within its parent process model, and as such it can only be invoked from within that process model.
sub-process


Exceptions are ________ that deviate a process from its normal course
events


The external application has to expose a service interface with which the enginecan interact. Thus, we simply refer to such applications as:
External services




__________is the component of a BPMS through whichprocess participants are (i) offered work items and (ii) commit to these.
Worklist Handler



A process model can be__________ to the engine in order to be executed.
deployed


Central to the BPMS is the execution engine. The engine providesdifferent functionalities including:
all of the above


The purpose of a BPMS is to coordinate an automated business process in sucha way that all work is done at the right time by the right resource.
True


It is a subject that may be approached from different angles. In abroad sense, it may refer to the intent to automate any conceivable part of proceduralwork that is contained within a business process, from simple operations that arepart of a single process activity up to the automated coordination of entire, complex processes.
Process Automation


Which of the followings are true about Value Chain:
all of the above



An activity in a process can invoke a separate sub-process. To use this feature: Decompose large models into smaller ones, making them easier to understand and maintain
True


It take all branches and proceed when all incoming branches have completed:
AND gateway

it is a work that is performed within a business process. 
Activity


Four types of core elements:
Activity, event, gateway, sequence flow


When capturing complex business processes, the resulting process model may be too large to be understood at once. Take the order fulfilment process model:
Process decompose


In order to use a _________, we first need to identify groups of related activities. [those activities which together achieve a particular goal or generate a particular outcome in the process model under analysis.]
Sub- Process
